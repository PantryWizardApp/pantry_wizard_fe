        Gruener Veltliner are my top picks for Salad. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner
        both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart
        vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.
        The Cycles Gladiator Chardonnay with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like
        a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":449227,"title":"Cycles
